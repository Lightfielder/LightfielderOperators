## History Stack

The History Stack window (`F6`) displays a three level hierarchy of all undoable actions in collapsible speech-bubble capsules. Each event block shows a timestamp, duration, and category color. Events of the same category are automatically grouped into a parent capsule with dynamically appended children.

![History Stack](Images/historystack.png)

## Three-Level Hierarchy

1. **Exploration Blocks** (root level)  
	Each creative iteration is wrapped in an "Exploration N" block. When you undo then perform new actions, a new exploration block is automatically created, preserving old history as inactive (diagonal stripe overlay). Click the `+` button in the toolbar to manually create a new exploration branch. Click an exploration block's title to inline-rename it.

2. **Category Groups** (children of exploration blocks)  
	Auto-grouped by event category (Navigation, Display Toggles, Selection, Create, etc.). Each category group composites its undo/redo across all its individual operations. Undo/redo at this level is `⌘+Z`/`⌘+Shift+Z` within the current block (within-block undo), or jumps between entire exploration blocks (block-level undo when at block boundaries).

3. **Individual Operations** (children of category groups)  
	Atomic events like "Zoom", "Pan", "Toggle Wireframe", "Adjust Up". Always undone/redone as part of their parent category group.

## Undo/Redo Behavior

- **Within-block**  
	  `⌘+Z` undoes the last category group in the current exploration block. `⌘+Shift+Z` redoes the last undone category group. Each category group's children are undone/redone together.

- **Block-level**  
	When at the first category group of a block, `⌘+Z` jumps to the previous exploration block (undoing all its events). `⌘+Shift+Z` from a fully-active block jumps to the next exploration block. Block-level navigation is also available via the ↩/↪ buttons on each block.

- **Exploration branching**  
	If you undo to a previous block and perform new actions, a new "Exploration N" block is created with those actions, while the old future blocks remain visible as inactive history. You can always navigate back to them.

## Save / Load

The Load and Save toolbar buttons default to the `History/` subfolder under `~/Library/Application Support/com.Lightfielder.Viewport/`. Saved JSONC files store the full event tree including event IDs, categories, timestamps, elapsed times, the current undo/redo position, within-block undone event IDs, and per-event fold/unfold states. Loading a file fully restores the History Stack UI to its saved state.

| Open Events | Load `.jsonc` history file from disk |
| Save Events | Save history to `.jsonc` file |
| Trash | Clear all events and start fresh |
| `+` (orange) | Create a new exploration block manually |
| Compress | Fold all group capsules |
| Expand | Unfold all group capsules |
